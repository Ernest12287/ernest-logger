# ðŸ“¦ Ernest-Logger Changelog

## [1.1.0] â€“ 2025-09-28

### âœ¨ New Features

- **Log Level Filtering**  
  Control verbosity with `level: 'debug' | 'info' | 'warn' | 'error'`.  
  Only logs at or above the selected level will be shown.

- **File Logging Support**  
  Enable persistent logging with `file: true`.  
  Logs are saved to `ernest.log` in the root directory.

- **Custom Log Levels**  
  Define your own emoji-powered log levels via `customLevels`.  
  Example:
  ```js
  customLevels: {
    deploy: { color: 'cyan', emoji: 'ðŸš€' },
    audit: { color: 'yellow', emoji: 'ðŸ“‹' },
  }
  ```

- **TypeScript Definitions**  
  Added `index.d.ts` for autocomplete and type safety in TypeScript projects.

âš¡ **Pull Requests:**
By default, I donâ€™t accept most PRs â€” this is a carefully curated project.
But if youâ€™ve got a **truly valuable fix or improvement** (performance boost, bug squash, or something that keeps the zero-bloat vibe), go ahead and open one. Iâ€™ll personally review and merge the gems.

This approach keeps Ernest-Logger lean, fun, and consistent â€” while still leaving room for the community to shine.
